# ðŸ“š Daily Grind: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my daily grind on Data Structures and Algorithms! ðŸš€ This repository is a collection of my daily progress, challenges, and solutions as I dive deeper into DSA concepts. The goal is to continuously sharpen my problem-solving skills and to get better at competitive programming, interviews, and real-world problem-solving.

## ðŸ›  Topics Covered
This repository will cover various essential topics, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks and Queues**
- **Trees and Binary Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Hashing**
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
- **Recursion and Backtracking**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Bit Manipulation**

## ðŸ“… My Daily Approach
- **Problem Solving**: Each day, I'll solve multiple problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
- **Learning New Concepts**: Iâ€™ll spend time learning new data structures, algorithms, and techniques that improve problem-solving efficiency.
- **Reflections**: At the end of each week, Iâ€™ll reflect on my progress, review mistakes, and fine-tune my approach.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- **Consistency**: Solve problems daily to build a strong foundation.
- **Optimization**: Focus not only on solving problems but also on finding the most efficient solutions.
- **Interview Readiness**: Aim to be fully prepared for technical interviews by mastering both theory and practice.
